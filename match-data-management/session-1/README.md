# Session 1 - Introduction and Data Transformation

For this session, we will quickly go over what R is, setting up R and the tidyverse suite of packages, using RStudio, and good and bad habits.

We will also go over the basic concepts of data transformation using the dplyr package (part of the tidyverse suite).

This session corresponds to the following sections of the [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) text:
* [1 Introduction](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html)
* [4 Workflow: basics](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html)
* [5 Data transformation](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html)

We will not be covering data visualization. Plotting and visualizing data is important in data science and it also helps with data management, but for now we will focus on the core data management skills. If there is sufficient interest, I will cover plotting using the powerful ggplot2 package at a later time. Everyone is welcome to review that section of the book on their own.
