This series of tutorials will emphasize data management (importing, manipulating, transforming, merging, grouping, and some common calculations). If there is enough interest, I can also cover plotting, common modeling, and programming. 

I want to state that the focus of these tutorials will not be the R language itself. However, we will be doing all of the data management in R. My intent for these tutorials is to help people do the job of data management as easily, quickly, and correctly as possible. We will be skipping some of the "important" R topics that aren't really important to convenient data management.

The book that we will be using is [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), which is great because it is co-written by Hadley Wickham, a major contributor to R and quite a celebrity within R circles, and it has a freely accessible version online.

To get started, do the following:
1. Download and install R: https://www.r-project.org/
2. Download and install RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/
3. Open RStudio and type and run `install.packages("tidyverse")` in the console to install the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) suite of packages.
